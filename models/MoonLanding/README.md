# Model of the Moon Lander (inspired from Peter Fritzon)

The MoonLanding.fmu file has been generated with JModelica using the python file MoonLanding.py. This fmu is compliant with Linux 64bits. 

To generate an FMU from the Modelica file (MoonLanding.mo), perform the following steps: 

1. Install JModelica for your OS. 
2. Launch the IPython console from JModelica. 
3. Launch the examples of the JModelica documentation to test the JModelica deployment. 
4. Place the MoonLanding.py file into the right folder (same folder as the fmu generated by the previous step) 
5. Launch the following commands:
	* import MoonLanding
	* MoonLanding.run_demo()
6. An FMU should be generated and simulated by JModelica.
